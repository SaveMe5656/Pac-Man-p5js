  notes: |
         I don't know if this is actually pre-alpha 4
         it would've helped if I had initially included version numbers when I started this project so I wouldn't have to make a rough estimate on which pre-alpha stage I'm on

2025-02-24:
  changelog:
  - added res/ resource folder
  - added CSV's relating to ghost behavior to res/
  - revamped changelog:
    used dates for each header opposed to versions
  next:
    - implement ghost behavior
    - add maze:
      - add maze sprites
      - implement collision:
        - player
        - ghost
  notes: |
         I probably should've used dates for releases since that makes more sense than making an arbitrary version system.
         oh well; at least it's been done now
